# [🚀 pISSstream](https://0x00er.github.io/pISSstream/)
it's a simple site that shows how full the International Space Station's urine tank is in real time:

(Yes... that was public information, cause It's publicly funded!)

Uses NASA's official public [ISS telemetry stream](https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/), provided by [Lightstreamer](https://lightstreamer.com/).

## 🥂 Why?
Why not? **obsessively watches the urine tank levels** on the International Space Station (ISS) !

This project exists because:
- I was bored.
- I love ISSMimic.
- Pee jokes are timeless.  
- Space is cool.
- Imagine a situation where all communication has broken down, and the only working sensor is the one in the piss-tank, and the astronauts have to communicate in morse by modulating the delta in the tank. And some guy with ADHD, lurcking on this site, is going to figure out whats going on what is going on, and save them all.
- You could potentially send a notification every time a crew member takes a whizz

It certainly has more interesting stats than just how full the piss tank is. However, I have no plans to add any of them.
